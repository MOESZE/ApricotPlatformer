# ApricotPlatformer
 
In this platformer game 'Apricot' you play as a cuboid inspired by the game 'Bloxorz'.

The goal is to survive for 60 seconds. However, be wary for the falling spherical objects that are trying to ruing your run as they rapidly fall from the sky and destroy any ground you might see as your only surviving opportunity.

In order to be able to run this project/game, you'll need Unity version 2019.4.29f1 at least. You can download the entire project and put it in a folder then import it into unity.

Whether you're playing the game or checking out the scripts, Have fun!.
